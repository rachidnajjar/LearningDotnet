Raise and Consume Events
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/events/how-to-raise-and-consume-events

The first example shows how to raise and consume an event that doesn't have data. 
It contains a class named Counter that has an event named ThresholdReached. 
This event is raised when a counter value equals or exceeds a threshold value. 
The EventHandler delegate is associated with the event, because no event data is provided.
