Raise and Consume Events
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/events/how-to-raise-and-consume-events

This example shows how to declare a delegate for an event. 
The delegate is named ThresholdReachedEventHandler. 
This is just an illustration. 
Typically, you do not have to declare a delegate for an event, because you can use either the EventHandler or the EventHandler<TEventArgs> delegate. 
You should declare a delegate only in rare scenarios, such as making your class available to legacy code that cannot use generics.
